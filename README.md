# project2
## Description:
This project focuses on practical cybersecurity training by exploring web application vulnerabilities, writing professional reports, solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, and mastering network scanning. It includes hands-on tasks with OWASP Juice Shop and TryHackMe's "Root Me" CTF, enhancing both offensive and defensive skills. Additionally, it incorporates developing a custom Python-based Nmap tool, fostering scripting and network analysis expertise.
**Assessment Methods:**
**Practical Exploration:**
**Identifying and documenting at least 5 vulnerabilities in OWASP Juice Shop.**
**Rooting a machine in the "Root Me" CTF.**
**Tool Proficiency:**
**Running Nmap scans on the Metasploitable or CTF server to detect services and vulnerabilities.**
**Developing a custom Python-based Nmap scanner that performs similar functions.**
**Report Writing:**
**Submitting a well-structured vulnerability assessment report on Juice Shop findings.**
**Including analysis, impact, and mitigation for identified vulnerabilities.**
**Learning Methods:**
**Hands-on experimentation with OWASP Juice Shop and TryHackMe challenges.**
**Guided and independent use of Nmap.**
**Python scripting for network analysis.**
**Research on professional report-writing techniques.**
## Requirements:
**Juice Shop** 
**Metasploitable**
**Burp Suite**
**TryHackMe account**
**Nmap**
**Gobuster**
**Metasploit**
